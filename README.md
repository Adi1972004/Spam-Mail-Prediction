This is a project that works on Spam/ham email classification under the use of Logistic Regression. It trains a model from a labeled dataset of email messages, some of which are spam and others ham, with TF-IDF feature extraction. Some key steps involve data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, besides having a predictive system for real-time spam detection.

Project Workflow
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset will include labeled emails, spam or ham.
Deal with missing values by replacing them with empty strings.
Label encoding is used to encode "spam" as 0 and "ham" as 1.
Feature Extraction:

We take text data like the content of an email and convert this text data into a numerical feature using TF-IDF Vectorizer. In this way, it will convert the raw text into a feature vector form that can be fed as an input to any machine learning model. Along with that, it also removes the common English stop words from the text.
Model Building:

Logistic Regression will act as the classification algorithm here. We will use 80% of the data for training and use the other 20% to determine how well this model will perform. Model Evaluation, AccuracyScore

Accuracy of the model is estimated on both train and test data through accuracy_score metric. The project has a pretty good accuracy on both training and testing data sets. Predictive System:

A predictive system classifies new email messages as spam or ham, based on the model trained. Transform the input e-mail text using TF-IDF vectorizer; make a prediction using the model, spam/ham. Results The model is doing quite well in recognizing e-mails and is reasonably accurate on both the training and test sets.
The predictor classifies a new e-mail dataset in real time, thus it could be practically applied into an e-mail filtering system.
